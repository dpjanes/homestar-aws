# IMPORTANT NOTE

If you install this, everything happening in your IOTDB / HomeStar installation
will be broadcast to AWS IoT MQTT. It's _private_ to you, but just beware.

# Installation

[Install Homeâ˜†Star first](https://homestar.io/about/install).

Then:

    $ homestar install homestar-aws

# Configuration

This will automatically configure itself if you have your HomeStar
API keys set up correctly.
